# Revision:
#
# The following patterns are allowed in the format string given to the $dt->strftime() method:

#     %a The abbreviated weekday name.
#     %A The full weekday name.
#     %b The abbreviated month name.
#     %B The full month name.
#     %c The default datetime format for the object's locale.
#     %C The century number (year/100) as a 2-digit integer.
#     %d The day of the month as a decimal number (range 01 to 31).
#     %D Equivalent to %m/%d/%y.
#     %e Like %d, the day of the month as a decimal number, but a leading zero is replaced by a space.
#     %F Equivalent to %Y-%m-%d (the ISO 8601 date format)
#     %G The ISO 8601 year with century as a decimal number. The 4-digit year corresponding to the ISO
#        week number (see %V). This has the same format and value as %Y, except that if the ISO week
#        number belongs to the previous or next year, that year is used instead. (TZ)
#     %g Like %G, but without century, i.e., with a 2-digit year (00-99).
#     %h Equivalent to %b.
#     %H The hour as a decimal number using a 24-hour clock (range 00 to 23).
#     %I The hour as a decimal number using a 12-hour clock (range 01 to 12).
#     %j The day of the year as a decimal number (range 001 to 366).
#     %k The hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number (range 0 to 23); single digits are preceded by a blank. (See also %H.)
#     %l The hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number (range 1 to 12); single digits are preceded by a blank. (See also %I.)
#     %m The month as a decimal number (range 01 to 12).
#     %M The minute as a decimal number (range 00 to 59).
#     %n A newline character.
#     %N The fractional seconds digits. Default is 9 digits (nanoseconds).

#          %3N   milliseconds (3 digits)
#          %6N   microseconds (6 digits)
#          %9N   nanoseconds  (9 digits)

#        This value will always be rounded down to the nearest integer.
#     %p Either 'AM' or 'PM' according to the given time value, or the corresponding strings for the current
#        locale. Noon is treated as 'pm' and midnight as 'am'.
#     %P Like %p but in lowercase: 'am' or 'pm' or a corresponding string for the current locale.
#     %r The time in a.m. or p.m. notation. In the POSIX locale this is equivalent to '%I:%M:%S %p'.
#     %R The time in 24-hour notation (%H:%M). (SU) For a version including the seconds, see %T below.
#     %s The number of seconds since the epoch.
#     %S The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 61).
#     %t A tab character.
#     %T The time in 24-hour notation (%H:%M:%S).
#     %u The day of the week as a decimal, range 1 to 7, Monday being 1. See also %w.
#     %U The week number of the current year as a decimal number, range 00 to 53, starting with the first Sunday
#        as the first day of week 01. See also %V and %W.
#     %V The ISO 8601:1988 week number of the current year as a decimal number, range 01 to 53, where week 1 is the
#        first week that has at least 4 days in the current year, and with Monday as the first day of the week. See
#        also %U and %W.
#     %w The day of the week as a decimal, range 0 to 6, Sunday being 0. See also %u.
#     %W The week number of the current year as a decimal number, range 00 to 53, starting with the first Monday as
#        the first day of week 01.
#     %x The default date format for the object's locale.
#     %X The default time format for the object's locale.
#     %y The year as a decimal number without a century (range 00 to 99).
#     %Y The year as a decimal number including the century.
#     %z The time-zone as hour offset from UTC. Required to emit RFC822-conformant dates (using "%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z").
#     %Z The time zone or name or abbreviation.
#     %% A literal '%' character.
#     %{method} Any method name may be specified using the format %{method} name where "method" is a valid DateTime.pm object method.
